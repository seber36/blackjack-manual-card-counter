manual card counter for blackjack
obviously it is what it is, its a manual counter so you have to manually put the cards in as the game is being played
i recommend using it only with certain online platforms that use 4 or less deck games
more than 4 decks you just gonna loose regardless
the less decks the better obviously

+2 count you should start increasing bet
+3 +4 +5 bet big

this is also not a garuntee way to win, don't be a degenerate
dont blame me if you loose your life savings
gamble responsibly

goodluck and happy winnings! (hopefully)
